                Nikola Tesla accomplished more in his lifetime than many of us could ever hope to achieve in a 100 lifetimes. Tesla held over 300 different patents, spanning several countries. From wireless technology to alternating current, electric motors, Radio, X-Rays, radar and laser technology…the list goes on.

                Nikola Tesla’s work would go on to inspire thousands of inventors, dreamers and engineers. To this very day, his inventions continue to shape life as we know it. You can’t help but wonder what the world would have looked like today if Nikola Tesla would have been able to finish his experiments with free energy and long range wireless energy transfer.

               <strong> Important moments in Tesla's life: </strong>

                <li><strong>1859</strong> - Nikola Tesla is born in Smiljan</li>
                <li><strong>1870</strong> - Tesla's Brush With Death 
                <p style="font-size:12px">Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Karlovac to complete his high school. Three years later, he went back to Smiljan and shortly after his arrival; he contracted cholera. He was in hospital for close to one year, and he faced near-death circumstances. </p></li>
                <li><strong>1875</strong> - Enrolls in College
                <p style="font-size:12px">Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined student and achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams. </p></li>
                <li><strong>1881</strong> - Begins His Career As Chief Electrical Engineer</li>
                <li><strong>1882</strong> - Goes to work for Edison</li>  
                <li><strong>1885</strong> - Submits some of his first patents</li> 
                <li><strong>1887</strong> - Starts reimagining the electric motor
                <p style="font-size:12px">In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a form of power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various benefits, especially in long-distance power transmission. In particular, the motor was operated by a polyphase current, which produced a rotating magnetic field to operate the motor. This innovative electric motor was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic self-starting design that did not require the use of commutators</p></li>
                <li><strong>1890</strong> - Begins work on wireless power</li>
                <li><strong>1891</strong> - Tesla patents the Tesla Coil</li>
                <li><strong>1943</strong> - Dies at the age of 86</li>
            </ul>
